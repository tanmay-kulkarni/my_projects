# My Machine Learning Projects

This repostitory contains some of the real-world ML problems I've worked on. These are stored as Jupyter Notebooks. Each notebook is independent and solves one problem end-to-end. GitHub sometimes takes too long or fails to render a notebook. If that happens, kindly copy the URL of the notebook and paste it at **nbviewer.jupyter.org** to view it.
