# My Machine Learning Projects

This repostitory contains some of the real-world ML problems I've worked on. These are stored as Jupyter Notebooks. Each notebook is independent and solves one problem end-to-end. GitHub sometimes takes too long or fails to render a notebook. If that happens, kindly copy the URL of the notebook and paste it at **nbviewer.jupyter.org** to view it.

The code is mostly Python. The main libraries I've used are 

	- Pandas (for tables and data manipulations)
	- Numpy (for data manipulation)
	- Matplotlib/Seaborn (For visualization)
	- sklearn (For traditional machine learning algorithms)
	- Keras/Tensorflow (for Neural networks/Deep learning)
	- NLTK (for common NLP tasks)
